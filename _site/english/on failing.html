        <p>This essay is inspired by an old lumberjack saying that is new to me: “The tree falls the way it leans”. The way I read this is that a man does not break all of a sudden. One doesn’t snap out of their dreams, discipline and goals. No one can pin point to the exact moment when they gave up on whaterver it was they set their mind to. it is only in retrospect that one can observe how the process of giving up actually developed. Of course there might be a specific moment where a man says: “that’s it! I’ve had enough. I am not meant for this.” Today I want to focus on what lead up to that. What causes the tree to lean in the direction it will eventually fall?</p>

<p>Well each one of us has its weaknesses that often take the form of temptations and bad habits. For someone might be smoking, drinking or gambling! For another man they might be women, porn, or drugs. For many it might be as simple and seemingly innocent as doom scrolling social media, eating too much or eating the wrong foods. Regardless of what form these temptations take, they leak into our life right when it time to lock in! When the project you work on and used to enjoy gets boring or too challenging. When you are tired and sore from the day before and your goal of going to the gym feels extremely weary today, that’s when your bad habits circle back in. That’s when the tree starts to lean.</p>

<p>Unfortunally there are no tricks or tips to solve this. A wise man once said: “Success is leased, not owned. And rent is due everyday” and this is it! If loosing looked like loosing nobody would give in. If you knew that, not going to the gym that specif Tuesday, or not putting that hour of coding your project that random afternoon when you promised you would have, or pushing off that due date that specif week out of laziness, if you knew that that was the seed of failure, than you wouldn’t have done it. The problem is that’s impossible to figure out which time you lean will be the time you can’t get up straight anymore. Sometimes you do skip a day at the gym and come back the day after stronger than before. Sometimes you procrastinate on that function you need to write or that blog post you need to publish and just get better ideas to make it work better.</p>

<p>Leaning, or “drifting” as Napoleon Hill calls this behavior in his book “Outwitting the Devil” is a risky bet. It is playing russian roulette with your dreams and goals. One time out of 6, that slip, that bit of laziness, might murder your chance of “making it” (whatever that means to you) forever!</p>

<p>Every action or inaction is a vote: you can either vote for the person you want to be or you can vote for the person you don’t want to be anymore.</p>

<p>But now, what then is true failure? What does “falling” actually look like? Falling, or failing is when one stops trying. When one looses that delusional sense of potential. Failing is accepting that we are what we are and that is what we are doomed to be! failing is the sudden realization that our innocent vote for the person we used to be gave it so much power that a coupe has silently taken place inside of us. That what used to be a democracy, striving for innovation, greatness, flourishing, well being, love, respect, goodness and happiness has been a replaced by a dictatoriship! And as all dictatorship it is run by fear, manipulation, dread, sadness, guilt, regret. It is sterile, brutal, selfish and it leads eventually to death.</p>

<p>One might loose this election young, giving up the illusion of being great, one bad habit at a time. Some accept external reality as fact later on bacause society says it’s too late!</p>

<p>And yet we all know that apart from physical death there is nothing we can bounce back from. These are the stories that inspire a select few that believe in themselves: David Goggings, coming back from obesity in hist late twenties. Alex Hormozi, coming back from near financial ruin and using his delusional beliefs to make it big!</p>

<p>The point of this is that failure starts with an innocuous act of lazyness, gets magnified over time by repeated and coherent drifting and then eventually crystallizes into spiritual death, death of ambition and desire for more. Inevitably this spiral solidifies into resentement towards the self, it manifests as diseases and lastly, physical death.</p>

<p>Don’t let this be you: don’t lean, don’t drift, not even once like you wouldn’t play russian roulette, don’t give in to lazyness, don’t die.</p>

<p>Love you, Gio &lt;3</p>
