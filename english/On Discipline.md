Discipline isn’t about suffering—it’s about trust. Most people think being disciplined means grinding harder, pushing through pain, and forcing themselves to do more. They’re wrong. Get this part wrong, and you’ll sabotage yourself.

There are two types of discipline: positive and negative.

Positive discipline is the ability to consistently take beneficial action, no matter how unmotivated or uncomfortable you feel in the moment. The obvious example? Hard physical activity—running, lifting weights, pushing through exhaustion. It’s painful, but it pays off in the long run with a fit, healthy body.

Negative discipline is the ability to consistently resist destructive actions, no matter how much you crave them. This one’s personal for me: I used to struggle with smoking and junk food. Every day, I win that battle again.

Both types are essential. To build a body that makes you feel strong and attractive, you need positive discipline to show up at the gym and negative discipline to avoid overeating processed garbage. Self-improvement is a two-sided coin: what you do and what you refuse to do.

Now, let’s talk brain.

On his podcast, PhD A. Huberman spoke with Navy SEAL and ultramarathoner David Goggins about a small structure in our brains: the anterior midcingulate cortex. This region grows when we force ourselves to do hard things. I like to think of it as a gland secreting willpower—the more you use it, the stronger it gets, like a muscle.

And that’s the key. Because we’re not just passengers in this life—we are our own leaders. And a great leader knows when to push and when to hold back.

Let’s say you set out to run five miles. Four miles in, you’re exhausted. Cutting it short makes you weak. But what if you get to 5 and still feel amazing? Go for six? That sounds hardcoreand badass,right? Actually, that’s self-betrayal too. Why? Because self-discipline isn’t just about grinding—it’s about trust. If you override your own plans just to punish or push yourself harder, your mind stops believing you. It will start fearing you and activate self-preservation mode.

Discipline isn’t just about suffering; it’s about following through on what you promised yourself. If you planned to push past your limits, then push. But if you planned to stop, stop. You need to trust that when you say, “I’m doing five miles today,” you’ll do five miles—no less, no more. That’s self-respect. If you constantly change the rules, you start second-guessing your own commands. And if you don’t trust yourself, discipline breaks down.

As a leader you should be hard and serious, of course, but you should also be fair. Discipline should be built on trust, not tyranny. If you rule yourself like a dictator, your body and mind will eventually rebel—whether that’s in the form of burnout, injury, or other forms of self sabotage tailored by your body for your body. Lethal.

Great things take time. You won’t get rich, jacked, or elite at anything in a year. Success isn’t owned—it’s leased, and rent’s due every day. But rent doesn’t mean suffering. It means consistent action, balanced leadership, and self-respect. So what keeps discipline sustainable for decades?

* Good incentives. Because your valuable time must be spent for a worthy ideal. A fit body, financial freedom, a good family, a happy, calm and cheerful life—these are worth the grind.  
* Love. Because you wouldn’t work hard for someone you don’t care about. Why should you be any different?  
* Respect. If you admire someone, you wouldn’t lie to them or let them down nor abuse them just because you have the power to. Do you not deserve that same level of respect?

That’s how you win this game—not just for a month, but for life.
