Here is why you should run and why you should do so without headphones, no music, no podcasts, just thoughts.

Out of respect for the reader and the countless professionals online I am going to avoid getting into the details of why running is good for the cardiovascular system etcetera, you already know that well. 
What they don’t tell you is the experienced benefits. First and foremost you are going to feel more energetic throughout the day. Assuming you are going to replenish the energy that you burnt during the session. 

For no reason you should see running as a way to “lose weight” or “get in shape” this is not how this works. And if you do wanna do some cardio for its own sake then trust me, there are way better ways to burn calories and sweat, running is arguably the least efficient and most boring, not to mention the stress on your joints. Just play pickleball, soccer or anything else unless your goal is self improvement, not just physical but mental too.


If you are committed then follow these two suggestions I wish I knew when I started: 

1. Run slow, like jogging, you will want to accelerate, resist that urge. This simple mindset will make running a lot more sustainable and speed will eventually come anyway as your competitive ass will want to surpass your records both in distance and speed. 

2. Buy a fanny pack to hold your phone so you can track your runs over time. Running with your phone in your pocket is annoying and you want to have the least amount of friction possible between you and your next run!

Now that you know the basics just run, but before you go out, hear me out on 2 things you want to know.
First of all you should be ready to fight with your brain. Running is not about your calves, quads or hamstring being exhausted, nor is it about your lungs burning and gasping for air. 
Running is all about fighting your brain and all the clever bullshit it is going to come up with to convince you to stop. Nobody knows you like your brain does. It will whisper all sorts of issues and concerns that might work for you right then and there. Winning in running is not about making the best time or running more than anybody else. If you are reading this the chances that you’ll ever beat a world record are slim to none. Winning in running is crushing your inner bitch, stabbing that weakness one step at a time. 

Your inner bitch voice will sound like yours, just like the devil it is a shapeshifter, but it is not your real voice! Those thoughts are not you. The real you is that voice that remembers what the plan was and that is the voice that you ought to listen to. Winning is just not losing for as long as you promised. And losing in this bubble of life is uniquely very clearly defined: not taking the next step. 

Do not use headphones because the devil inside you is not defeated by ignoring it. It can only be trumped by facing its lies and… laughing at them. 
Laugh at the thought that you are going to pass out. Laugh at the thought that you will pull a tendon if you don’t stop running. These are just examples of what your inner bitch might whisper. But whatever these might be for you: listen to them and their ridiculousness, refuse to accept them and instead laugh at them as you take another step towards your more disciplined self. Another stab and the part of you that is okay with giving up. 

Winning at running is winning yourself. 

Now put your shoes on and enjoy the battle.
